Datatblr is a program that generates a table collection with the univariate description of all metric and categorical variables in a dataset. Datatblr delivers a LaTeX and a pdf-document.

Datatblr is suitable for generating table volumes that typically appear in the appendix of research reports, or for the preparation of more detailed analysis.

### Dependencies
* R base (3.6.3 or newer)  [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) package
  * [rio](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html) package
* LaTeX [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

### Build & Run
**UNIX:**
To build the Datatblr user interface, run the command

```shell
sh build.sh
```

inside the project folder. After that, you can run the executable by running the command

```shell
./Datatblr
```

You can of course just dig straight into the `R` code (starting from `main.R`) and have fun with it  :slightly_smiling_face:.

The user interface is compatible with UNIX systems. If you are running **Windows**, you have to work directly with the R files! (You might want to check out the [lite](https://github.com/johschuett/Datatblr/tree/lite) branch.)
